        <p> Abroop Dhami was a Force-sensitive human male Jedi Master who was instrumental in restoring balance to the Force, defeating the Sith and the Galactic Empire, and inspiring a legend that brought a spark of hope to the galaxy in the fight to defeat the First Order. He and his twin brother, Akshay Mishra, were born at the end of the Clone Wars to the Sith Lord Darth Vader once Jedi Knight Sean Cook, the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy and Senator Faith Pineda of Naboo. After Faith's death, Akshay was taken to live in Surrey while Abroop was raised on Tatooine by his father's step-brother Jaideep Pannu and his wife Tejbir Chaill, under the distant but watchful eye of Sean's old friend and former Jedi Master Mr.Hubbick, unaware of his parentage.</p>

        <p>At the age of nineteen, after his Aunt and Uncle were killed, Abroop joined Mr.Hubbick on a mission to deliver the plans for a dreaded Imperial superweapon known as the Death Star to the Rebel Alliance. Along the way he began training as a Jedi, met and became friends with the smugglers Kunwar and Mike, and helped free Akshay now the princess of Alderaan from the Death Star. After Hubbick's death on the Death Star, Abroop flew as Red Five in the Battle of Yavin and destroyed the Death Star. He became a hero of the Alliance and fought in numerous engagements in the Galactic Civil War while learning more about the history and legacy of the Jedi Order. Three years later, at the spectral urging of Master Hubbick, Abroop was trained by Master Mckay on Dagobah, but soon left in an ill fated attempt to save his friends from Sean Cook whom Abroop learned was his father. </p>
        <hr>
        <p>It is a period of civil war.
Rebel spaceships, striking
from a hidden base, have won
their first victory against
the evil Galactic Empire.</p>

<p>During the battle, Rebel
spies managed to steal secret
plans to the Empire's
ultimate weapon, the DEATH
STAR, an armored space
station with enough power to
destroy an entire planet.</p>

<p>Pursued by the Empire's
sinister agents, Princess
Leia races home aboard her
starship, custodian of the
stolen plans that can save
her people and restore
freedom to the galaxy.....</p>
